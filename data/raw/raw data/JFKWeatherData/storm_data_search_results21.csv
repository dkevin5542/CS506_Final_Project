As a cold front moved slowly east and displaced warm, moist, and unstable air; lines of heavy showers and thunderstorms occurred.

Torrential rain resulted in widespread flash flooding of streets, low lying and poor drainage areas, mainly in 2 lines:  one line extending  across Western Staten Island northeast across Hudson County, NJ and another line extending from the Eastern Shores of Staten Island northeast across Western Brooklyn, Southern Manhattan, and Northwest Queens.  The highest rainfall rates were between 2 and 3 inches per hour.  The Storm Total Rainfall at LaGuardia Airport was 2.78 inches and at Central Park was 1.98 inches.

This intense low pressure system spread snowfall into the region Sunday morning, with bands of heavy snow plus embedded thunderstorms and very strong winds affecting the region Sunday afternoon through Sunday night. The powerful blizzard (defined when sustained winds or frequent gusts greater than or equal to 35 mph accompanied by falling and/or blowing snow, frequently reducing visibility to less than 1/4 mile for three hours or more) brought a widespread area of 20 to 30 inches of snow across the NYC metro and Lower Hudson Valley, with 10 to 20 inches across Long Island. The heavy snow was accompanied by area wide winds of 25 to 40 mph and gusts in excess of 60 mph Sunday afternoon into Sunday night, resulting in near whiteout conditions with blowing and drifting snow and making all forms of travel extremely difficult to nearly impossible. In fact, all three major New York Airports were closed during and for a period after the storm. Bus service was severely hampered, and all service on the LIRR and several lines of MTA North, MTA subway, and PATH were suspended Sunday night into Monday morning due to high snow drifts. New York City struggled with snow removal due to the overwhelming blowing and drifting snow and stranded or abandoned buses and cars littering the streets, which severely hampered emergency services response times. In addition, 8000 customers lost power in New York City and Southern Westchester Counties, 8500 in Putnam and Northern Westchester, and 12,000 on Long Island during the height of the storm.",127

In addition, JFK Airport experienced 1 to 3 feet of inundation onto portions of their runways.||Across the Rockaways, up to 4 and 7 feet of inundation occurred over the peninsula due to surge from Jamaica Bay on the north side and from surge and wave action from the Atlantic Ocean on the south side. Widespread major damage was experienced across the entire length of the Rockaways, with numerous homes and businesses in Breezy Point, Arverne-Edgemere and Seaside experiencing complete destruction. Atlantic Ocean facing shoreline structures, such as boardwalks and several oceanfront homes were destroyed due to runup and setup on top of storm tide from high wave action of at least 10 to 15 feet from the Atlantic Ocean.||Six fatalities were directly attributed to the storm surge and high surf in Queens.","Post Tropical Storm Sandy was the costliest natural disaster in Southeast New York.||Tropical Storm Sandy formed in the Caribbean Sea on October 22.

Hurricane Sandy emerged on the other side of Cuba during the morning of the 25th and proceeded to drift northwest as a category one or two hurricane as it moved through the Bahamas on the 25th and 26th. Overnight on the 26th, Hurricane Sandy (Category 1) started to move toward the north northeast, a motion that continued into the evening of the 28th. From there, Sandy���s motion became driven by two factors. An anomalously strong blocking ridge over the Canadian Maritimes prevented Sandy from escaping to the east. Simultaneously, an approaching and deepening extratropical trough was about to capture Sandy. The combination of the two, turned Sandy to the north overnight on the 28th and then to the northwest on the 29th.||As Sandy continued to move northwest and interact with the mid latitude trough, its interaction continued to make it less tropical, but did not weaken it much. Sandy continued to make a harder turn to the left (west) and made landfall in Atlantic County as a post tropical storm in Brigantine City just north of Atlantic City at 7:30 p.m. EDT on the 29th.

Additionally, rough surf of 4 to 6 ft on far western Long Island Sound caused damage to marinas across��coastal Westchester County. ||Rainfall amounts of 1/2 to 4 1/2 inches were observed across the Lower Hudson Valley, highest amounts across western areas, with 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches observed across NYC, and generally less than an inch across Long Island.||One death resulted from the high winds:|A 60 yr old man was killed in the Briarwood section of Queens near the intersection of 84th Drive and 143rd Street near Smedley Street from a tree falling on his vehicle.||One injury resulted from the high winds:|A woman was critically injured when a falling tree branch hit her while walking on Dumont Avenue in Brownsville Brooklyn.||Preliminary damage cost estimates for Public Assistance are:|||The number of power outages statewide peaked around 920000 on August 4-5th, with many outages lasting several days to a week.
