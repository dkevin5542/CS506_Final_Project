# CS506 Project: Airport Flight Delay Prediction Midterm Report

## Goal
The ability to predict an airports's length of weather delay in minutes is what we hope our model will achieve. Using weather data like the amount of precipitation and the average temperature per month in that specific airports' location to help us train the model.

## Data Cleaning
We are using old data records of airports to do this specifically airport records from teh year 2024. So the data would only include data from the 12 months within that year. We are only taking into consideration the flights that leave and arrive at the JFK, so we can filtering out all airports expect for JFK. We are only considering delays that are effected by weather so we can lower the amount of variablabilies that we need to consider as not all delays happen for the same reason, as some delays could happen due to security reasons. So we would also filter out all other reasons of delay expect weather out of the total delays that JFK have had in.
